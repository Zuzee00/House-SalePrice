# House-SalePrice
Predicting House sale-price given various features about it

### this is what I am doing in this project:

- Understanding the problem. Considering each variable and performing an analysis get an idea about its importance for this problem.
- Univariable study. focusing on the dependent variable ('SalePrice').
- Multivariate study. trying to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
- Basic cleaning. cleaning the dataset and handling the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
- Test assumptions. checking if our data meets the assumptions required.
